I have created a mailing list to communicate to those who would like updates on my work, outside of crumbling social media. I expect to send out updates on a 3 to 6 month interval at best.

Email updates will include:

1) New posts or tutorials on my website.\
2) Upcoming major performances or lectures.\
3) (in future) Secret updates and early questions on physical goods, such as art prints or electronic hardware ;)

## Join my mailing List

I'm new to mailing lists. If you encounter weird issues or can't unsubscribe, reach out and I'll fix it.

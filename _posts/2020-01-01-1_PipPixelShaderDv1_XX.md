In 2020 I slipped into the "[jit.gen](https://docs.cycling74.com/legacy/max8/refpages/jit.gen){:target="_blank"}" and "[jit.gl.pix](https://docs.cycling74.com/legacy/max7/refpages/jit.gl.pix){:target="_blank"}" side of Max/MSP for making low-resolution patterns. By stacking ~10 different jit.gl.pix effects and remapping and blending inputs, I got some of the loops here. I didn‚Äôt know at the time that this was a ‚Äúshader‚Äù, what a slippery slope indeed.

These clips started with a blank three-channel image matrix and use math to change the RGB color values of each pixel. No external images or video inputs. 

The two below include audio from my early attempts at LSDJ:

Max/MSP enables audio-based control of multiple variables, and I started trying real-time image generation based on audio frequencies. In December 2020, I ran my first visualist demo on Twitch to see how this reactive shader might behave in a music performance.

While this version made very complex and deep patterns, there was a lot of performance issues when adding audio-reactivity. Dv2.XX was the remake that aimed to simplify and optimize the patch.

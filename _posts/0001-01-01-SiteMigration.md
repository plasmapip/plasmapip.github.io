Hey there! I recently rebuilt this site (July 2024), so older posts are pending transfer as I re-format them.

My portfolio was previously a wordpress site hosted on a budget webhost. Turns out, trying to switch from one predatory host to another is a non-trivial process. If I'm able to maintain this new site correctly, I might add some details here about how I (hopefully) got out of predatory web hosting for the time being...
